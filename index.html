					Favorite thing about The Potato: "Its failure became a watershed in the history of Ireland."
					</div>
					<br>
					About two-fifths of the population was solely reliant on this crop for a number of historical reasons. The failure of the crop due to the potato blight and the subsequent famine was a watershed in the history of Ireland. Its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political and cultural landscape. For both the native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk memory and became a rallying point for various Home rule and United Ireland movements, as the whole island was then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
